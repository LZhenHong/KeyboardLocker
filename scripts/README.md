./scripts/build_release.sh
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Full Xcode archive build
- âœ… Optimized for distribution
- âœ… Code signing and symbol stripping
- âœ… Detailed build information
- âœ… Automatic cleanup

### `quick_build.sh`
**Quick Development Build Script**
- Fast build without archive process
- Suitable for testing and development
- Skips some optimization steps for speed

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/quick_build.sh
```

**Features:**
- âš¡ Fast build time
- ðŸ”§ Development-focused

- ðŸ§¹ Automatic cleanup

## Build Requirements

- macOS 13.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Valid code signing identity
- Accessibility permissions (for testing)

## Output
